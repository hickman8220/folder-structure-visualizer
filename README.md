# 📁 Folder Structure Visualizer

**Folder Structure Visualizer** is a developer tool that converts ASCII folder trees into an interactive visual explorer and allows exporting the structure as a downloadable scaffold ZIP.

Instead of manually creating dozens of folders and files when starting a project, you can paste a tree structure and generate the entire scaffold instantly.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📂 ASCII → Visual Tree**
  Paste a standard ASCII folder tree and instantly visualize it.

- **🌳 Collapsible Folder Explorer**
  Expand or collapse folders like a real file explorer.
  - **🔍 Smart Search & Highlight**
    Instantly search files and folders by name.
  - Highlights matching text in real-time
  - Automatically expands relevant folders
  - Filters out non-matching branches for clarity

- **📊 File & Folder Counters**
  Automatically counts total files and directories.
  - **🎨 Intelligent File Icons**
    Automatically assigns icons based on file types and names.
  - Supports multiple languages (JS, TS, Python, Java, C/C++, etc.)
  - Recognizes config files (`package.json`, `.env`, `vite.config`)
  - Enhances readability like a real IDE file explorer

- **📋 Copy Path**
  Click any file or folder and copy its full path.

- **📄 Copy Tree as Markdown**
  Export the folder structure as Markdown.

- **📦 Download Project Scaffold**
  Generate and download a ZIP containing the entire folder structure.
  - **⚛️ React + Vite Preset**
    Instantly generate a ready-to-run React + Vite frontend scaffold.

- **🎨 Tailwind CSS Preset**
  Add Tailwind CSS configuration and generate a styled starter homepage.

- **🟦 TypeScript (TSX) Preset**
  Generate TSX-based React scaffolds with `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `vite.config.ts`, and TypeScript config files.

- **🧩 Node + Express Preset**
  Generate a backend starter with Express and a clean folder structure.

- **🖥 Custom Starter Screens**
  Generated React scaffolds include a branded startup homepage with setup instructions.

- **⚠️ Vite 8 Node Warning**
  Generated frontend scaffolds show a built-in Node.js version warning for Vite 8 compatibility.

- **🚫 Smart Ignore Rules**
  Automatically filters out generated folders like
  `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, and `coverage`.

- **🖱 Drag & Drop Input**
  Drop ASCII trees directly into the editor.

- **🧠 Flexible Parsing**
  Supports both standard ASCII trees (├──, └──, │) and indentation-based structures.
  Indentation is only valid under folders (lines ending with /).

- **✨ Smooth UI Interactions**
  - Animated folder expand/collapse
  - Rotating chevrons for visual feedback
  - Subtle hover and click effects for better UX

### Input

```text
my-app/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Navbar.jsx
│   │   └── Footer.jsx
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── HomePage.jsx
│   ├── App.jsx
│   └── main.jsx
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### Result

This becomes an **interactive visual tree** inside the UI.

## 📦 Scaffold Export

The **Download ZIP** feature creates a project scaffold where the ZIP file is automatically named after your **root folder**.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> All files are generated as **empty files**, allowing developers to start coding immediately without manually creating folders and files.

### Included Scaffold Presets

The scaffold system can optionally generate starter files for:

- **React + Vite**
- **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**
- **React + Vite + TypeScript (TSX)**
- **React + Vite + TypeScript (TSX) + Tailwind CSS**
- **Node + Express API**
- **Root `.gitignore`**

These presets are merged into the parsed folder tree and exported as part of the ZIP.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React (Vite)
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend Preset:** Node.js, Express
- **Icons:** Lucide React & React Icons
- **ZIP Generation:** JSZip

---

## ⚛️ Generated Frontend Presets

When scaffold options are selected, the exported ZIP can generate frontend starter projects with:

### JSX Preset

- `App.jsx`
- `main.jsx`
- `vite.config.js`

### TSX Preset

- `App.tsx`
- `main.tsx`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `vite-env.d.ts`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tsconfig.app.json`
- `tsconfig.node.json`

### Tailwind Support

When Tailwind is enabled, the scaffold also includes:

- `tailwind.config.js`
- `postcss.config.js`

  ### Styling Behavior

The scaffold intelligently adapts styling based on selected options:

- **With Tailwind CSS enabled**
  - Uses utility-first styling
  - Does NOT generate `App.css`
  - Includes Tailwind config and directives in `index.css`

- **Without Tailwind**
  - Generates a standard `App.css`
  - Uses traditional CSS styling

This ensures clean, minimal, and relevant project output without unused files.

### Vite 8 Compatibility Note

Generated frontend starter pages include a visible warning that Vite 8 requires:

- **Node.js 20.19+**, or
- **Node.js 22.12+**

## 🚀 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/folder-structure-visualizer.git
```

Navigate into the project:

```bash
cd folder-structure-visualizer
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input** – User pastes an ASCII folder tree.
2. **Parsing** – The parser converts the text into a nested JSON data structure.
3. **Visualization** – The UI renders the structure as a collapsible file explorer.
4. **Action** – The structure can then be:
   - copied as Markdown
   - explored visually
   - exported as a ZIP scaffold (ignoring build artifacts)

---

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

The application is optimized for responsiveness and smooth interaction:

- Efficient tree rendering using recursive components
- Search operates with lightweight string matching (`includes`)
- Only relevant branches are displayed during filtering
- Minimal DOM updates ensure good performance even on mobile devices

For extremely large folder trees, performance remains stable due to controlled rendering and state management.

## 🏆 Highlights

- Built a recursive tree rendering system from scratch
- Designed a dynamic scaffold generator with conditional file creation
- Implemented intelligent file-type recognition and icon mapping
- Created a responsive and animated file explorer UI
- Developed a real-world developer utility tool with practical use cases

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Quick Scaffolding** – Set up new projects in seconds.
- **Repo Visualization** – Understand complex repository structures instantly.
- **Architecture Sharing** – Share project designs with teammates.
- **Documentation** – Generate clean trees for README files.
- **Preset-Based Project Bootstrapping** – Generate React, TSX, Tailwind, and Express starter structures instantly.
